I wander’d lonely as a cloud

That floats on high o’er vales and hills,

When all at once I saw a crowd,

A host , of golden daffodils;

Beside the lake, beneath the trees,

Fluttering and dancing in the breeze.

Continuous as the stars that shine

And twinkle on the Milky way,

They stretch’d in never-ending line

Along the margin of a bay:

Ten thousand saw I at a glance,

Tossing their heads in sprightly dance.

The waves beside them danced, but they

Out-did the sparkling waves in glee:

A poet could not but be gay

In such a jocund company!

I gaze –and gazed –but little thought

What wealth the show to me had brought:

For oft, when on my couch I lie

In vacant or in pensive mood,

They flash upon that inward eye

Which is the bliss of solitude;

And then my heart with pleasure fills,

And dances with the daffodils.

独自漫游似浮云，

青山翠谷上飘荡；

一刹那瞥见一丛丛、

一簇簇水仙金黄；

树荫下，明湖边，

和风吹拂舞翩跹。

仿佛群星璀璨，

沿银河闪霎晶莹；

一湾碧波边缘，

绵延，望不尽；

只见万千无穷，

随风偃仰舞兴浓。

花边波光潋滟，

怎比得繁花似锦；

面对如此良伴，

诗人怎不欢欣！

凝视，凝视，流连不止；

殊不知引起悠悠情思；

兀自倚憩息，

岑寂，幽然冥想；

蓦地花影闪心扉，

独处方能神往；

衷心喜悦洋溢，

伴水仙、舞不息。
