If you're finding it tough to land a job，try expanding your job-hunting plan to include the following tactics：

Set your target. While you should always keep your options open to compromise，you should also be sure to target exactly what you want in a job. A specific job hunt will be more efficient than a haphazard one. 

 Schedule ample interviews. Use every possible method to get interviews

nswering ads，using search firms，contacting companies directly，surfing the Web，and networking. Even if ajob is not perfect for you，every interview can be approached as a positive experience.

Follow up. Even if someone does not hire you，write them a thank you note for the interview. Then，some weeks later，send another brief letter to explain that you still have not found the perfect position and that you will be available to interview again if the original position you applied for，or any other position，for that matter，is open. Do this with every position you interview for，and you may just catch a break.

Make it your full-time job. You can't find a job by looking sporadically。You have to make time for it. If you're unemployed and looking，devote as much time as you would to a full-time job. If you have a job while you're looking，figure out an organized schedule to maximize your searching time.

Network vertically. In the research phase of your job hunt，talk to people who are on a level above you in your desired industry. They'll have some insights that people at your own level won't have，and will be in a good position to hire you or recommend you to be hired. Keep your spirits up. Looking for a job is one of the toughest things you will ever have to do. Maintain your confidence，stay persistent，and think positively，and eventually you will get a job that suits you.

如果你觉得找工作是件棘手的事情，不妨扩展你找工作的计划，纳入以下策略：

定下目标。尽管你应该永远给你的选择留有妥协余地，你也应确切知道你到底想从某份工作中获取什么。明确具体地寻找工作要比漫无目的地碰机会有效得多。

安排尽可能多的面谈。尽量利用一切办法去争取面试机会——回复招聘广告，求助搜寻公司，直接与公司联系，网上搜寻，利用各种关系网，等等。即便某份工作对你不是最为理想的，但每次面谈都可以是一次有积极作用的经历。

继续努力！即便人家没有雇用你，给他们写张感谢卡，对给你安排了一次面试机会表示感谢。数周之后，如果你申请的原职位——或与此相关的其他职位——尚无人选落实，你不妨再寄去一封简短的信说你还未找到理想的职位，如有机会再面试一次将随叫随到。你每次应聘面试求职都应这样，没准儿你就会抓住一个机会。

将找工作视为全职工作。你偶然随便地找，不可能找到一份理想的工作，你必须去花时间找。如果你失业了想再找份新工作，尽可能多地付出时间就像你在全职工作一样。如果你有工作，但还想找新的机会，制定一个有序的计划尽可能多地安排出时间去搜寻。

纵向发展关系。在找工作的研究阶段，找机会去和你渴望进入的行业中比你高一层次的人物交谈。他们会有你这层次人物所不具备的视野，会有能力雇用你或将你推荐给其他雇主。心情愉快，充满希望。找工作是你必须做的最为棘手的事情之一。保持信心，坚持不懈，态度乐观，最终你会找到适合你的工作的。
