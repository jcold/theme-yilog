Each of us has our own idea of what Cheese is, and we pursue it because we believe it can makes ushappy. If we get it, we often become attached to it. And if we lose it, or it’s taken away, it can be traumatic. The “Maze” in the story represents where you spend time looking for what you want. It can be the organization you work in, the community you live in, or the relationships you have in your life. In the storyyou will see that the two mice do better when they are faced with change because they keep things simple, while the two little people’s complex brains and human emotions complicate things. It is not that mice are smarter. We all know people are more intelligent than mice. However, as you watch what the four characters do, and realize both the mice and the little people represent parts of ourselves, the simple and the complex, you can see it would be to our advantage to do the simple things that work when things change.

《谁动了我的奶酪》讲的是一个关于“变化”的故事。故事发生在一个迷宫中，有四个可爱的小生灵在迷宫中寻找他们的奶酪。故事里的“奶酪”是对我们在现实生活中所追求目标的一种比喻，它可以是一份工作，一种人际关系，可以是金钱，一幢豪宅，还可以是自由、健康、赏识、精神自由，甚至还可以只是一项运动，如慢跑、高尔夫球等。我们每个人的内心都有自己想要的“奶酪”，我们追寻它，想要得到它，因为我们相信，它会带给我们幸福和快乐。而一旦我们得到了自己梦寐以求的奶酪，又常常会对它产生依赖心理，甚至成为的附庸。这时如果我们忽然失去了它，或者它被人拿走了，我们将会因此而受到极大的伤害。故事里的“迷宫”代表着你花时间寻求着的东西所在的地方，它可以是你效力的机构，你生活的社区，亦或是你生活中的某种人际关系。在故事里，你会发现，当面对变化时两个老鼠做得比两个小矮人要好，因为他们总是把事情简单化，而当两个小矮人所具有的复杂的脑筋和人类的情感，却总是把事情变得复杂化。这并不是说老鼠比人更聪明。我们都知道人类更具智慧。当你观察故事中四个角色的行为时，你会发现，其实老鼠和小矮人代表我们自身的不同方面，简单的一面和复杂的一面，当事物发生变化时，或许简单行事会给我们带来许多的便利和益处。
