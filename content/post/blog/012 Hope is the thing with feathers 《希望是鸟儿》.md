Hope is the thing with feathers

That perches in the soul,

And sings the tune without the words,

And never stops at all.

The sweetest in the gale is heard;

And sore must be the storm

That could abash the little bird

That kept so many warm.

I've heard it in the chillest land,

And on the strangest sea;

Yet, never, in extremity,

It asked a crumb of me.

**中文翻译**

希望是鸟儿，

在人们心灵栖居，

唱着无词的歌儿，

永无止息。

心灵是甜蜜的避风港

只有猛烈的风暴，

才能威胁希望，

这慰藉心灵的小鸟。

它歌唱在最寒冷的地方

最陌生的海洋

纵然身处绝境，

也不索取分毫。
