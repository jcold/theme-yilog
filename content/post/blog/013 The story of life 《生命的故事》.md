Sometimes people come into your life and you know right away that they were meant to be there, to serve some sort of purpose, teach you a lesson, or to help you figure out who you are or who you want to become. You never know who these people may be(possibly your roommate, neighbor, coworker, long lost friend, lover, or even a complete stranger), but when you lock eyes with them, you know at that very moment they will affect your life in some profound way.

And sometimes things happen to you that may seem horrible, painful, and unfair at first, but in reflection you find that without overcoming those obstacles you would have never realized your potential, strength, willpower, or heart.

Everything happens for a reason.

Nothing happens by chance or by means of good luck.

Illness, injury, love, lost moments of true greatness, and sheer stupidity all occur to test the limits of your soul. Without these small tests, whatever they may be, life would be like a smoothy paved, straight, flat road to nowhere. It would be safe and comfortable, but dull and utterly pointless.

The people you meet who affect your life, and the success and downfalls you experience, help to create who you are and who you become.

Even the bad experiences can be learned from.

In fact, they are probably the most poignant and important ones.

If someone hurts you, betrays you, or breaks your heart, forgive them, for they have helped you learn about trust and the importance of being cautious when you open your heart.

If someone loves you, love them back unconditionally, not only because they love you, but because in a way, they are teaching you to love and how to open your heart and eyes to things.

Make every day count.

Appreciate every moment and take from those moments everything that you possibly can for you may never be able to experience it again.

Talk to people that you have never thalked to before, and actually listen.

Let yourself fall in love, break free, and set your sights high.

Hold your head up because you have every right to.

Tell yourself you are a great individual and believe in yourself, for if you don’t believe in yourself, it will be hard for others to believe in you.

You can make of your life anything you wish.

Create your own life and then go out and live it with absolutely no regrets.

Most importantly, if you LOVE someone, tell him or her, for you never know what tomorrow may have in store.

有时候，一些人进入你的生命，你马上知道他们是注定要出现的。他们的到来是为了达成某种目的，给你提供教益，帮助你认清自己以及自己想要成为怎样的人。你不会知道这些人是谁（很可能会是你的室友、邻居、同事、失散多年的朋友、爱人，甚至是素未谋面的陌生人），可是当你的目光锁定他们的那一刻，你就知道他们会给你的生命带来深远的影响。

有时候，发生在你身上的事情看似可怕、痛苦和不公平，但仔细一想，你就会发现，如果不克服这些障碍，你就不会意识到自己的潜能、力量、意志和决心。

任何事的发生都是有原因的。

没有事情是偶然出现或运气使然。

疾病、伤痛、爱情、与成功失之交臂，以及彻彻底底的糊涂犯错，这些都是对你精神极限的考验。无论这些小小的考验是什么，没有了它们，生命就像是一条不知通往何处的平坦大道，纵然安全舒适，但却了然无趣、毫无意义。

你所遇到的影响你生命的人，你所经历的成功与失败，都有助于塑造和成就你的人生。

即使是不好的经历，也能从中吸取经验。

事实上，这些经验可能是最深刻和最重要的。

如果有人伤害了你，背叛了你，或伤了你的心，原谅他们吧，因为他们帮助你理解了信任，让你懂得了在敞开心扉时保持谨慎是很重要的。

如果有人爱你，你要无条件地爱他们，不仅因为他们爱你，还因为他们教会了你去爱，以及如何敞开你的心扉、放开你的目光。 

 让每一天都过得有价值。

珍惜生命中的每一刻，并尽你所能地从中取得收获，因为你不会有从头再来的可能。

跟那些你从来没有说过话的人交谈，并注意聆听。

让自己去爱，挣脱束缚，让目光高远。

要昂起头，因为你有权利这么做。

告诉自己，你是一个伟大的人，并相信自己，因为如果你不相信自己，别人就很难相信你。

你可以做任何想做的事来塑造你的人生。

创造你自己的人生，并无怨无悔地去过这一生吧。

最重要的是，如果你爱某个人，就告诉他/她，因为你不知道明天将会怎样。
